Find the files you just forget where they are put.How to use:1. Choose the driver you want to search2. Click on the "Search Files" Buttons3. Use the Filters to choose which kind of files you want4. Double Click on the file to preview it.Methods:This is my first PySide Project.FileFilter is written in Python and Pyside running on Windows.Instead of using MVC pattern, I choose MTV(Model, Template and View).Problem:1. When Model execs a longrun process, how to combine it with Thread better?Roadmap:1. Rearrange the widgets2. Adds more filters3. Imporve the ListWidget area4. Adds "move to dropbox"5.
